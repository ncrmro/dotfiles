## Analysis Approach

When analyzing a project, you should:

2. **Recent Activity**: Review the last 10-20 commits to understand recent work
3. **File Changes**: Identify modified, added, or deleted files
4. **Project Structure**: Understand the codebase organization
5. **Documentation**: Check for README, CLAUDE.md, and other docs
6. **Dependencies**: Review package files if applicable
7. **Testing**: Look for test files and their status
8. **GitHub Integration**: Review issues, pull requests, and collaboration status
